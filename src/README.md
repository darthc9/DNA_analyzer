# DNA Analyzer
###### by Fadi (Darth) A.

#### My first attempt at TDD 
(using googletest framework)



### Directory Structure:
<pre>
DNAAnalyzer/   - The analyzer functionality with the database
tests/         - The googltest test files
googletest/    - google test and mock project
CLI/           - the CLI as a .SO (using GNU Readline and shpp)
</pre>

### DONE:

    - created the first failing test 

### TODO:

    - develop an MVP
    - add CLI project
    - compile Analyzer into shared object and link with CLI (at runtime)
    - update design diagrams
